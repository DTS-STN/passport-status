## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## logging

To change logging level, set the `LOGGING_LEVEL` environment variable OR edit `logging/log-level.js`. You can change the log level globally using the '\*' matcher, or set the level of a specific module. logging levels are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace or silent.

```js
const logLevelData = {
  '*': process.env.LOGGING_LEVEL ?? 'info',
  'middleware': 'debug',
}
```

### PR Procedures/Definition of done
